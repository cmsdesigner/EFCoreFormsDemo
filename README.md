# Using Entity Framework Core 2.1 with Xamarin.Forms

With the release of Entity Framework Core 2.1 (EFCore) there is now a new alternative to established object relational mappers like SQLite.Net, when building mobile apps with Xamarin.

This repo is the code I am using in my Xamarin University Lightning Lecture "Using Entity Framework Core 2.1 in Xamarin.Forms" which can be found at https://university.xamarin.com/lightninglectures once it's published.
